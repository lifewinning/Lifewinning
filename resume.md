## Wait But How Do You Make Money?

I do a range of things to make money. Sometimes I do residencies and fellowships, freelance writing words, freelance writing code, and sometimes sell things I've made. I also have a [Patreon](http://patreon.com/lifewinning) that helps cover the bills. 

And, yes, I could always use more work. If you think I could be useful to your endeavors please get in touch at [lifewinning@gmail.com](mailto:lifewinning@gmail.com).
