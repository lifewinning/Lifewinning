## Wait But How Do You Make Money?

I do a range of things to make money. Sometimes I do residencies and fellowships, freelance writing words, freelance writing code, and sometimes sell things I've made. I also have a [Patreon](http://patreon.com/lifewinning) that helps cover the bills. 

And, yes, I could always use more work. If you think I could be useful to your endeavors please get in touch at [lifewinning@gmail.com](mailto:lifewinning@gmail.com). 


## Actual Resume

#### Freelance Journalist | 2013-Present

Primarily writing about technology and network infrastructure for various outlets, including *The Nation*, *Rhizome*, and a multi-part series on internet infrastructure for *The Atlantic*. Full inventory of clips [here](http://lifewinning.com/tag/writes).

#### The Training Commission | 2019

*[The Training Commission](http://trainingcommission.com)* was a science fiction novella co-written with Brendan C. Byrne and published as an email newsletter. Set in an alternate future in which the United States of America undergoes a semi-automated (and inevitably broken) truth and reconciliation process, the narrative interwove interviews with real-life experts on technology, human rights, and the messy intersections of the two with a political thriller narrative. At peak, we had around 3000 subscribed readers and at one point broke TinyLetter. (In slightly grim honors, *The Training Commission* was recently [highlighted by *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/15/books-to-read-while-quarantined-coronavirus) as a great quarantine read.)

#### Future Perfect | 2017-2018

A conference hosted at Data & Society Research Institute on worldbuilding and its discontents in science fiction, policy, and history. I curated the programming for the conference and in 2018 commissioned, edited, and designed print editions of three original works of speculative fiction by Ruha Benjamin, Rose Eveleth, and Lou Cornum. Documentation for [2017](https://datasociety.net/events/future-perfect-conference/) and [2018](https://datasociety.net/output/future-perfect-2018/) on the Data & Society website.

A collection of free, open teaching modules for education on network infrastructure, internet governance, and core network protocols. Initially developed in collaboration with Surya Mattu, with the support of Data and Society Research Institute and the Knight Prototype Fund. In addition to the work produced with the Knight grant, we’ve adapting modules from Networks Land and developed new curriculum for a the New York City Department of Education’s Computer Science For All initiative. More information at the [Networks Land website](http://networks.land/).

#### Networks of New York | 2014-16

*Networks of New York* is a field guide to finding the internet on the streets of New York City through visual identifiers of network infrastructure. The book began as a self-published artist’s book project and website created while a resident at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center in 2014, and then was revised and expanded for a new edition with Melville House Press in 2016.

#### Freelance Development, The Intercept | 2015

Freelance in-house development project building a CMS (Flask/MySQL backend) for keeping track of all published excerpts from the Snowden archive, as well as all reporting connected to said published documents Architecture was originally designed for a public-facing API of document metadata, but shelved due to timing and maintenance concerns. (Project remains under NDA but if actually curious, I can provide the login for a dev version still running on theintercept.horse)
