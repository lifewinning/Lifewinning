## Wait But How Do You Make Money?

I do a range of things to make money. Sometimes I do residencies and fellowships, sometimes I write words, sometimes I write code, and sometimes I sell things I've made. I also have a [Patreon](http://patreon.com/lifewinning) that helps cover the bills. Graduating from college into a recession has made me pretty good at improvising. 

And, yes, I could always use more work. If you think I could be useful to your endeavors please get in touch at [lifewinning@gmail.com](mailto:lifewinning@gmail.com).
