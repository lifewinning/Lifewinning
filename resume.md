#### Other Work and Projects

##### Content Strategy, Community Tech New York | 2020

Consultant on communications strategy and editorial support for a local nonprofit focused on building community power through locally controlled internet infrastructure. 

##### Head Writer, Researcher, and Host, RIP Corp | 2020

[RIP Corp](http://ripcorp.biz) is a monthly reported podcast from independent production studio Charts & Leisure. Each episode tells the story of a business failure, based on the proposition that understanding how companies fail can illuminate how capitalism actually works (and who it works for). Topics covered have varied, including Enron's role in the history of streaming video and why leveraged buyouts are the dumbest idea in the world but private equity tricked people into thinking they were good.

##### The Training Commission | 2019

*[The Training Commission](http://trainingcommission.com/)* was a science fiction novella co-written with Brendan C. Byrne and published as an email newsletter. Set in an alternate future in which the United States of America undergoes a semi-automated (and inevitably broken) truth and reconciliation process, the narrative interwove interviews with real-life experts on technology, human rights, and the messy intersections of the two with a political thriller narrative. At peak, we had around 3000 subscribed readers and at one point broke TinyLetter. (In slightly grim honors, *The Training Commission* was [highlighted by *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/15/books-to-read-while-quarantined-coronavirus) as a great quarantine read.)

##### Future Perfect | 2017-2018

A conference hosted at Data & Society Research Institute on worldbuilding and its discontents in science fiction, policy, and history. I curated the programming for the conference and in 2018 commissioned, edited, and designed print editions of three original works of speculative fiction by Ruha Benjamin, Rose Eveleth, and Lou Cornum. Documentation for [2017](https://datasociety.net/events/future-perfect-conference/) and [2018](https://datasociety.net/output/future-perfect-2018/) on the Data & Society website.

##### Freelance Development, The Intercept | 2015

Freelance in-house project building a CMS (Flask/MySQL backend) for keeping track of all published excerpts from the Snowden archive, as well as all reporting connected to said published documents Architecture was originally designed for a public-facing API of document metadata, but shelved due to timing and maintenance concerns. (Project remains under NDA but if actually curious, I can provide the login for a dev version still running on theintercept.horse)
