## Wait But How Do You Make Money?

I do a range of things to make money--pick up residencies and fellowships, freelance writing words, freelance writing code, and sometimes sell things I've made (well, really I just sold this one book I made one time).

And, yes, I could always use more work. Money is hard when you're self-employed! If you think I could be useful to your endeavors please [get in touch](mailto:lifewinning@gmail.com). Or if you know a cool foundation that would fund me just being weird let me know, I've been looking for them.
