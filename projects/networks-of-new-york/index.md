*Networks of New York* is a field guide to finding the internet on the streets of Manhattan. It documents different signs of buried network infrastructure and easily overlooked networked objects (sensors, cameras, cell towers, and more), as well as some major carrier hotels in New York City. 

Originally produced as a [website](http://seeingnetworks.in/nyc/) and a self-published [book](http://seeingnetworks.in/guide) while a resident at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center, it was later revised and expanded for [Melville House Press](www.mhpbooks.com/books/networks-of-new-york/), where I got to work with some really fantastic people.
