*LittleNets* was a show of alternative networks hosted on Governor's Island during Eyebeam's "Off The Grid" summer programming in 2014. I invited Dan Phiffer and Sarah Grant to present their work building localized mesh neworks and set up an instance of Commotion, a mesh platform maintained by the Open Technology Institute. On the Commotion platform there was an etherpad for people who wanted to take or leave notes, an exhibition of animated gif art curated by Rachel Binx, and a reading room of relevant material curated by me. 

Probably the best part of this exhibition was when Aaron Straup Cope gave a talk for it. He put his notes for that talk [here](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2014/10/06/interpretation/#brick).

All of these photos were taken from [Eyebeam's Flickr Account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/eyebeam/albums) because I was really not thinking about documentation when I put this show together.
