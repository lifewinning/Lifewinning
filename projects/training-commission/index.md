*[The Training Commission](http://trainingcommission.com)* was a science fiction novella co-written with Brendan C. Byrne and published as an email newsletter. Set in an alternate future in which the United States of America undergoes a semi-automated (and inevitably broken) truth and reconciliation process, the narrative interwove interviews with real-life experts on technology, human rights, and the messy intersections of the two with a political thriller narrative. At peak, we had around 3000 subscribed readers and at one point broke TinyLetter.
