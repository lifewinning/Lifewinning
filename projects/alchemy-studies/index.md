During the summer of 2018 I ground an iPhone 5 into a pile of dust using a range of hardware and household appliances, then cast the dust into a resin sphere. I wanted to make the device unfamiliar and unrecognizable. I hadn't intended to really deeply document the process of grinding down the phone because I didn't think that was particularly interesting, but as friends expressed curiosity about the process I started taking photos. 

I wrote a little about this work in an essay for [The Creative Independent](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/sand-in-the-gears/) and spoke about it a little in [this talk](https://video.techfestival.co/ingrid-burrington-at-techfestival-2018-the-true) at Techfestival 2018. There will be more dusted phones in 2019.
