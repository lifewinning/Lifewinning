A collaboration with Meredith Whittaker created for Rhizome's annual [Seven on Seven](http://sevenonseven.rhizome.org) conference, *The Realm of Rough Telepathy* is the title of a grimoire Meredith and I discovered in an obscure archive of the New York Public Library while researching the history of cryptography. 

The grimoire--which is mostly in fragments, pages often transforming before our very eyes--documents what is either a magical dimension uncanniliy similar to the internet as we now know it or in fact a prophetic text documenting the history of the internet and how it works today. The text also includes a variety of unique sigils.

Scholarship on the text is ongoing. You can watch Meredith and I talking about the work [here](https://vimeo.com/167158975).
