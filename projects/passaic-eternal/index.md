Collaboration with [Charles Harlan](http://charlesharlan.com)

Passaic Eternal is an exploration of the physical and intellectual geography of Robert Smithson's essay "A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic", originally published in _Artforum_ in 1976. Our project took the form of a [website](http://passaiceternal.com), an [essay](passaiceternal.pdf), a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=fDhYnGQE4cs), and [photographs](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/charlesharlan/sets/72157626185093183/).
