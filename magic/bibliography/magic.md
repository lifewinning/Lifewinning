A friend recently asked me for a reading list of things related to technology, magic, and the long and complex relationship the two have had to one another. I added some tags and a very clumsy search function on this list because like, IDK I could and I expect this to grow. 

This is far from a complete reading list, and it betrays some of my own personal interests in this subject matter. Totally welcome more recommendations!
